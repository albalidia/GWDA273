  <p><center>
    With superior quality, a charming atmosphere and friendly baristas (clad in Rag & Bone uniforms), Alfred Coffee is a neighborhood favorite for well-crafted coffee. Since Alfred’s flagship location debuted on Melrose Place in 2013, this popular shop has opened two outposts—one on Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood and another on San Vicente in Brentwood—as well as two new locations in Silverlake and Studio City opening later this year. While every shop boasts a unique vibe, every Alfred locations is guided by the mantra “But first, coffee” and features a modern aesthetic of black-and-white tiling, indie antler decor and rustic bar stools. A collaboration with Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Alfred’s exclusive signature blend features a rich medley of dark chocolate, fruit and marzipan flavors. Take your brew in a chocolate-dipped waffle cone to satisfy your sweet tooth, or reach for a nitro cold brew on tap to cool down on hot afternoons. Whichever you choose, break out your phone—this is one coffee-shop visit worth Instagramming.
